################# NK Comments #################
# You've chosen the range that has only 20% of likely values, not 60%. You chose
# the 60% and 40% quantiles. That means 40% of data points are below this region
# and 100%-60% = 40% are above this region. 
# To find the 60% region, note that this mean 40% is outside the region: 20% 
# above and 20% below. So you need to find the 20% and 80% quantiles instead.

##Checkpoint 4: How does this distribution differ from the distribution when we only sampled 10 individuals?
## This sample is more acurate and is not swayed as much by the extremes. The sample with a 100 has a bit higher average
################# NK Comments #################
# One of the most important differences is that the distribution with more 
# samples is narrower.

################# NK Comments #################
# All the code looks right, but the confidence intervals are all NA's. That is 
# because there are missing entries for height just like there was for 
# cholesterol. The way to fix this is to remove missing values before you do
# your calculations, just like we did with cholesterol.
